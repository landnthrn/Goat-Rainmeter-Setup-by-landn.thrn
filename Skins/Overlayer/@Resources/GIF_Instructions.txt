GIF Animation Support for Overlayer Plugin
==========================================

The Overlayer plugin now supports animated GIFs! Here's how to use this feature:

STEP 1: Prepare Your GIF
------------------------
1. Place your GIF file in the UserImages folder
2. Rename it to "animation.gif"

STEP 2: Split the GIF into Frames
---------------------------------
1. Run the "split_gif.bat" script in the @Resources folder
2. This will create individual frame files: frame_0.gif, frame_1.gif, frame_2.gif, etc.
3. Count how many frame files were created

STEP 3: Configure Overlayer
---------------------------
1. Open Jaxcore and go to Overlayer settings
2. Set "Layering image" to point to frame_0.gif (or any frame file)
3. Set "GIF total frames" to the number of frames you counted in step 2
4. Configure other settings as needed (position, size, etc.)

STEP 4: Test
------------
1. Activate the Overlayer plugin in Jaxcore
2. Your GIF should now animate on your desktop!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The plugin automatically detects .gif files and enables animation
- For regular images (PNG, JPG), the plugin works as before
- The animation speed is controlled by the Update rate (currently set to 50ms)
- Make sure all frame files are in the same folder as specified in GIFPath

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If animation doesn't work, check that all frame files exist
- Make sure the "GIF total frames" count matches the actual number of frames
- Verify that ImageMagick is installed if you're using the batch script
- Check that the GIFPath variable points to the correct folder

For transparent GIFs:
- The transparency should be preserved in the individual frame files
- Make sure your GIF was created with proper transparency support
